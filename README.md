## Introduction

In the retail analytics domain, it's crucial to have a well-structured data warehouse that can handle large volumes of data and support complex analytical queries. This project leverages the principles of Data Vault modeling and the power of DBT to achieve this objective.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **models**: Contains DBT models for transforming raw data into business-ready tables.
- **scripts**: Includes SQL and Python scripts for various data processing tasks.
- **config**: Holds configuration files for DBT and other components.
- **tests**: Contains test cases to ensure the correctness of the data transformations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [DBT](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction)
- [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)
- [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/retail-analytics-dbt.git
   ```

2. Install DBT:

   ```bash
   pip install dbt
   ```

3. Set up your Snowflake and Redshift connections in the `profiles.yml` file.

## Configuration

1. Configure your DBT profiles in the `profiles.yml` file under the `profiles` directory.

2. Update the connection details in the `dbt_project.yml` file to match your Snowflake or Redshift setup.

## Usage

1. Run DBT to build the data warehouse:

   ```bash
   dbt run
   ```

2. Test the transformations:

   ```bash
   dbt test
   ```

3. Generate documentation:

   ```bash
   dbt docs generate
   ```

4. View documentation:

   ```bash
   dbt docs serve
   ```
